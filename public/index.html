      Hello
    </h1>
    <p>
      I am a static file. I live in the public directory but node serves me here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Node also serves up our api routes off of <quote class="code">/api/</quote>. To use them better, download the PostMan chrome extension.
      After you've done that you can make post and get and patch and put and even delete requests!
    </p>
